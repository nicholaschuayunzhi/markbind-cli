    </p>
    <p>There are many techniques used during a requirements gathering. The following are some of the techniques.</p>
    <h4 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h4>
    <p>Brainstorming is a group activity designed to generate a large number of diverse and creative ideas for the solution of a problem. In a brainstorming session there are no &quot;bad&quot; ideas. The aim is to generate ideas; not to validate them. Brainstorming
      encourages you to &quot;think outside the box&quot; and put &quot;crazy&quot; ideas on the table without fear of rejection.</p>
    <h4 id="user-surveys">User surveys</h4>
    <p>Carefully designed questionnaires can be used to solicit responses and opinions from a large number of users regarding any current system or a new innovation.</p>
    <h4 id="focus-groups">Focus groups</h4>
    <p>Focus groups are a kind of informal interview within an interactive group setting. A
      <tooltip content="e.g. potential users, beta testers">group of people</tooltip>
      are asked about their understanding of a specific issue or a process. Focus groups can bring out undiscovered conflicts and misunderstandings among stakeholder interests which can then be resolved or clarified as necessary.</p>

requirements capture are some of the terms commonly <strong>and</strong> interchangeably used to represent the activity
of understanding what a software product should do.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Specifying requirements</strong>: <span>As we establish requirements, they should be recorded in some way for future reference,
usually called a requirement specification. Furthermore, it is advisable to show these requirements to stakeholders,
and refine requirements based on their feedback. The next phase is to convert requirements into a product
specification that specifies how the product will address the requirements. </span></li>

    <h2 id="feature-list">Feature list</h2>
    <p>It is a list of features (or functionalities) grouped according to some criteria such as priority (e.g. must-have, nice-to-have, etc. ), order of delivery, object or process related (e.g. order-related, invoice-related, etc.). Here is a sample feature
      list from Minesweeper (only a brief description has been provided to save space).</p>
